# Java Programming 10th Edition
This repo will contain my code that I have produced whilst reading and doing the exercises in 
[Introduction to Java Programming, Tenth Edition.](http://www.cs.armstrong.edu/liang/intro10e/)
This was the book recommended to me during my introduction to Java programming unit that I did 
at university in my ICT degree. It is a really good book and I would highly recommend it for people
who are new to Java, want a refresher, or want another perspective on things.
