UTF-8 is an ASCII-preserving encoding method for Unicode (ISO 10646), the Universal Character Set (UCS). The UCS encodes most of the world's writing systems in a single character set, allowing you to mix languages and scripts within a document without needing any tricks for switching character sets. This web page is encoded directly in UTF-8.

As shown HERE, Columbia University's Kermit 95 terminal emulation software can display UTF-8 plain text in Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, XP, Vista, or Windows 7/8/10 when using a monospace Unicode font like Andale Mono WT J or Everson Mono Terminal, or the lesser populated Courier New, Lucida Console, or Andale Mono. C-Kermit can handle it too, if you have a Unicode display. As many languages as are representable in your font can be seen on the screen at the same time.

This, however, is a Web page, which started out as a kind of stress test for UTF-8 support in Web browsers, which was spotty when this page was first created in the 1990s but which has become standard in all modern browsers. The problem now is mainly the fonts and the browser's (or font's) support for the nonzero Unicode planes (as in, e.g., the Braille and Gothic examples below). And to some extent the rendition of combining sequences, right-to-left rendition (Arabic, Hebrew), and so on. CLICK HERE for a survey of Unicode fonts for Windows.

The subtitle above shows currency symbols of many lands. If they don't appear as blobs, we're off to a good start!

From Laȝamon's Brut (The Chronicles of England, Middle English, West Midlands, ca.1190):

    An preost wes on leoden, Laȝamon was ihoten
    He wes Leovenaðes sone -- liðe him be Drihten.
    He wonede at Ernleȝe at æðelen are chirechen,
    Uppen Sevarne staþe, sel þar him þuhte,
    Onfest Radestone, þer he bock radde.

From the Tagelied of Wolfram von Eschenbach (Middle High German):

    Sîne klâwen durh die wolken sint geslagen,
    er stîget ûf mit grôzer kraft,
    ich sih in grâwen tägelîch als er wil tagen,
    den tac, der im geselleschaft
    erwenden wil, dem werden man,
    den ich mit sorgen în verliez.
    ich bringe in hinnen, ob ich kan.
    sîn vil manegiu tugent michz leisten hiez.

Some lines of Odysseus Elytis (Greek):

    Monotonic:

    Τη γλώσσα μου έδωσαν ελληνική
    το σπίτι φτωχικό στις αμμουδιές του Ομήρου.
    Μονάχη έγνοια η γλώσσα μου στις αμμουδιές του Ομήρου.

    από το Άξιον Εστί
    του Οδυσσέα Ελύτη
    	Polytonic:

    Τὴ γλῶσσα μοῦ ἔδωσαν ἑλληνικὴ
    τὸ σπίτι φτωχικὸ στὶς ἀμμουδιὲς τοῦ Ὁμήρου.
    Μονάχη ἔγνοια ἡ γλῶσσα μου στὶς ἀμμουδιὲς τοῦ Ὁμήρου.

    ἀπὸ τὸ Ἄξιον ἐστί
    τοῦ Ὀδυσσέα Ἐλύτη

The first stanza of Pushkin's Bronze Horseman (Russian):

    На берегу пустынных волн
    Стоял он, дум великих полн,
    И вдаль глядел. Пред ним широко
    Река неслася; бедный чёлн
    По ней стремился одиноко.
    По мшистым, топким берегам
    Чернели избы здесь и там,
    Приют убогого чухонца;
    И лес, неведомый лучам
    В тумане спрятанного солнца,
    Кругом шумел.

Šota Rustaveli's Veṗxis Ṭq̇aosani, ̣︡Th, The Knight in the Tiger's Skin (Georgian):

    ვეპხის ტყაოსანი შოთა რუსთაველი

    ღმერთსი შემვედრე, ნუთუ კვლა დამხსნას სოფლისა შრომასა, ცეცხლს, წყალსა და მიწასა, ჰაერთა თანა მრომასა; მომცნეს ფრთენი და აღვფრინდე, მივჰხვდე მას ჩემსა ნდომასა, დღისით და ღამით ვჰხედვიდე მზისა ელვათა კრთომაასა.

Tamil poetry of Subramaniya Bharathiyar: சுப்ரமணிய பாரதியார் (1882-1921):

    யாமறிந்த மொழிகளிலே தமிழ்மொழி போல் இனிதாவது எங்கும் காணோம்,
    பாமரராய் விலங்குகளாய், உலகனைத்தும் இகழ்ச்சிசொலப் பான்மை கெட்டு,
    நாமமது தமிழரெனக் கொண்டு இங்கு வாழ்ந்திடுதல் நன்றோ? சொல்லீர்!
    தேமதுரத் தமிழோசை உலகமெலாம் பரவும்வகை செய்தல் வேண்டும்.

Notes:

    The "I can eat glass" phrase and initial translations (about 30 of them) were borrowed from Ethan Mollick's I Can Eat Glass page (which disappeared on or about June 2004) and converted to UTF-8. Since Ethan's original page is gone, I should mention that his purpose was to offer travelers a phrase they could use in any country that would command a certain kind of respect, or at least get attention. See Credits for the many additional contributions since then. When submitting new entries, the word "hurt" (if you have a choice) is used in the sense of "cause harm", "do damage", or "bother", rather than "inflict pain" or "make sad". In this vein Otto Stolz comments (as do others further down; personally I think it's better for the purpose of this page to have extra entries and/or to show a greater repertoire of characters than it is to enforce a strict interpretation of the word "hurt"!):

        This is the meaning I have translated to the Swabian dialect. However, I just have noticed that most of the German variants translate the "inflict pain" meaning. The German example should read:

            "Ich kann Glas essen ohne mir zu schaden."

        rather than:

            "Ich kann Glas essen, ohne mir weh zu tun."

        (The comma fell victim to the 1996 orthographic reform, cf. http://www.ids-mannheim.de/reform/e3-1.html#P76.

        You may wish to contact the contributors of the following translations to correct them:

            Lëtzebuergescht / Luxemburgish: Ech kan Glas iessen, daat deet mir nët wei.
            Lausitzer Mundart ("Lusatian"): Ich koann Gloos assn und doas dudd merr ni wii.
            Sächsisch / Saxon: 'sch kann Glos essn, ohne dass'sch mer wehtue.
            Bayrisch / Bavarian: I koh Glos esa, und es duard ma ned wei.
            Allemannisch: I kaun Gloos essen, es tuat ma ned weh.
            Schwyzerdütsch: Ich chan Glaas ässe, das tuet mir nöd weeh.

        In contrast, I deem the following translations *alright*:

            Ruhrdeutsch: Ich kann Glas verkasematuckeln, ohne dattet mich wat jucken tut.
            Pfälzisch: Isch konn Glass fresse ohne dasses mer ebbes ausmache dud.
            Schwäbisch / Swabian: I kå Glas frässa, ond des macht mr nix!

        (However, you could remove the commas, on account of http://www.ids-mannheim.de/reform/e3-1.html#P76 and http://www.ids-mannheim.de/reform/e3-1.html#P72, respectively.)

        I guess, also these examples translate the wrong sense of "hurt", though I do not know these languages well enough to assert them definitely:

            Nederlands / Dutch: Ik kan glas eten; het doet mĳ geen pĳn. (This one has been changed)
            Kirchröadsj/Bôchesserplat: Iech ken glaas èèse, mer 't deet miech jing pieng.

        In the Romanic languages, the variations on "fa male" (it) are probably wrong, whilst the variations on "hace daño" (es) and "damaĝas" (Esperanto) are probably correct; "nocet" (la) is definitely right.

        The northern Germanic variants of "skada" are probably right, as are the Slavic variants of "škodi/шкоди" (se); however the Slavic variants of " boli" (hv) are probably wrong, as "bolena" means "pain/ache", IIRC.

    That was from July 2004. In December 2007, Otto writes again:

        Hello Frank, in days of yore, I had written:
        > "Ich kann Glas essen ohne mir zu schaden."
        > (The comma fell victim to the 1996 orthographic reform,

        cf. http://www.ids-mannheim.de/reform/e3-1.html#P76.

        The latest revision (2006) of the official German orthography has revived the comma around infinitive clauses commencing with ohne, or 5 other conjunctions, or depending from a noun or from an announcing demonstrative (http://www.ids-mannheim.de/reform/regeln2006.pdf, §75). So, it's again: Ich kann Glas essen, ohne mir zu schaden.

        Best wishes,
             Otto Stolz

    The numbering of the samples is arbitrary, done only to keep track of how many there are, and can change any time a new entry is added. The arrangement is also arbitrary but with some attempt to group related examples together. Note: All languages not listed are wanted, not just the ones that say (NEEDED).

    Correct right-to-left display of these languages depends on the capabilities of your browser. The period should appear on the left. In the monospace Yiddish example, the Yiddish digraphs should occupy one character cell.

    Yoruba: The third word is Latin letter small 'j' followed by small 'e' with U+0329, Combining Vertical Line Below. This displays correctly only if your Unicode font includes the U+0329 glyph and your browser supports combining diacritical marks. The Lingala and Indic examples also include combining sequences.

    Includes Unicode 3.1 (or later) characters beyond Plane 0.

    The Classic Mongolian example should be vertical, top-to-bottom and left-to-right. But such display is almost impossible. Also no font yet exists which provides the proper ligatures and positional variants for the characters of this script, which works somewhat like Arabic.

    Taiwanese is also known as Holo or Hoklo, and is related to Southern Min dialects such as Amoy. Contributed by Henry H. Tan-Tenn, who comments, "The above is the romanized version, in a script current among Taiwanese Christians since the mid-19th century. It was invented by British missionaries and saw use in hundreds of published works, mostly of a religious nature. Most Taiwanese did not know Chinese characters then, or at least not well enough to read. More to the point, though, a written standard using Chinese characters has never developed, so a significant minority of words are represented with different candidate characters, depending on one's personal preference or etymological theory. In this sentence, for example, "-tàng", "chia̍h", "mā" and "bē" are problematic using Chinese characters. "Góa" (I/me) and "po-lê" (glass) are as written in other Sinitic languages (e.g. Mandarin, Hakka)."

    Wagner Amaral of Pinese & Amaral Associados notes that the Brazilian Portuguese sentence for "I can eat glass" should be identical to the Portuguese one, as the word "machuca" means "inflict pain", or rather "injuries". The words "faz mal" would more correctly translate as "cause harm".

    Burmese: In English the first person pronoun "I" stands for both genders, male and female. In Burmese (except in the central part of Burma) kyundaw (က္ယ္ဝန္‌တော္‌) for male and kyanma (က္ယ္ဝန္‌မ) for female. Using here a fully-compliant Unicode Burmese font -- sadly one and only one Padauk Graphite font exists -- rendering using graphite engine. Unicode 4.0 or older standard did not have some medial and vowel character; the second example has them.

    From Louise Hope, 22 November 2010:  I decided to have a go at an Inuktitut rendering, mainly in hopes of shaming someone who actually knows the language into coming up with something better. Meanwhile, try this:

    ᐊᓕᒍᖅ ᓂᕆᔭᕌᖓᒃᑯ ᓱᕋᙱᑦᑐᓐᓇᖅᑐᖓ
    aliguq nirijaraangakku suranngittunnaqtunga

    Loosely: I am able not to hurt myself whenever I eat glass.

    aliguq >> glass (uninflected because it is the patient of a transitive verb in an ergative language)
    nirijaraangakku >> "I eat him/her/it" in Frequentative mood (all one verb with inflectional ending, no affixes whatsoever)
    suranngittunnaqtunga >> suraq (do permanent harm) + nngit (verb-negator) + tunnaq (ability) + tunga (intransitive ending, making the verb passive or reflexive)

    See above about someone who knows the language, et cetera.

    Script trivia: the syllable ᙱ is a single unicode character representing the two elements ᓐ (syllable-final n) and ᖏ (syllable ngi). I think they just did it that way because it looks tidier than the expected ᓐᖏ. If your operating system didn't come with Euphemia (all-purpose UCAS font), you can download Pigiarniq. It comes with a jolly little inuksuk ᐀ that the Unicode Consortium is trying to make into a squatter.

The Quick Brown Fox... Pangrams
The "I can eat glass" sentences do not necessarily show off the orthography of each language to best advantage. In many alphabetic written languages it is possible to include all (or most) letters (or "special" characters) in a single (often nonsense) pangram. These were traditionally used in typewriter instruction; now they are useful for stress-testing computer fonts and keyboard input methods. Here are a few examples (SEND MORE):

    English: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
    Jamaican: Chruu, a kwik di kwik brong fox a jomp huova di liezi daag de, yu no siit?
    Irish: "An ḃfuil do ċroí ag bualaḋ ó ḟaitíos an ġrá a ṁeall lena ṗóg éada ó ṡlí do leasa ṫú?" "D'ḟuascail Íosa Úrṁac na hÓiġe Beannaiṫe pór Éava agus Áḋaiṁ."
    Dutch: Pa's wĳze lynx bezag vroom het fikse aquaduct.

    Norwegian: Blåbærsyltetøy ("blueberry jam", includes every extra letter used in Norwegian).
    Swedish: Flygande bäckasiner söka strax hwila på mjuka tuvor.
    Icelandic: Sævör grét áðan því úlpan var ónýt.
    Finnish: (5) Törkylempijävongahdus (This is a perfect pangram, every letter appears only once. Translating it is an art on its own, but I'll say "rude lover's yelp". :-D)
    Finnish: (5) Albert osti fagotin ja töräytti puhkuvan melodian. (Albert bought a bassoon and hooted an impressive melody.)
    Finnish: (5) On sangen hauskaa, että polkupyörä on maanteiden jokapäiväinen ilmiö. (It's pleasantly amusing, that the bicycle is an everyday sight on the roads.)
    Polish: Pchnąć w tę łódź jeża lub osiem skrzyń fig.
    Czech: Příliš žluťoučký kůň úpěl ďábelské kódy.
    Slovak: Starý kôň na hŕbe kníh žuje tíško povädnuté ruže, na stĺpe sa ďateľ učí kvákať novú ódu o živote.
    Slovenian: Šerif bo za domačo vajo spet kuhal žgance.
    Greek (monotonic): ξεσκεπάζω την ψυχοφθόρα βδελυγμία
    Greek (polytonic): ξεσκεπάζω τὴν ψυχοφθόρα βδελυγμία
    Russian: Съешь же ещё этих мягких французских булок да выпей чаю.
    Russian: В чащах юга жил-был цитрус? Да, но фальшивый экземпляр! ёъ.
    Bulgarian: Жълтата дюля беше щастлива, че пухът, който цъфна, замръзна като гьон.
    Sami (Northern): Vuol Ruoŧa geđggiid leat máŋga luosa ja čuovžža.
    Hungarian: Árvíztűrő tükörfúrógép.
    Spanish: El pingüino Wenceslao hizo kilómetros bajo exhaustiva lluvia y frío, añoraba a su querido cachorro.
    Spanish: Volé cigüeña que jamás cruzó París, exhibe flor de kiwi y atún.
    Portuguese: O próximo vôo à noite sobre o Atlântico, põe freqüentemente o único médico. (3)
    French: Les naïfs ægithales hâtifs pondant à Noël où il gèle sont sûrs d'être déçus en voyant leurs drôles d'œufs abîmés.
    Esperanto: Eĥoŝanĝo ĉiuĵaŭde.
    Hebrew: זה כיף סתם לשמוע איך תנצח קרפד עץ טוב בגן.
    Japanese (Hiragana):

        いろはにほへど　ちりぬるを
        わがよたれぞ　つねならむ
        うゐのおくやま　けふこえて
        あさきゆめみじ　ゑひもせず (4)

Notes:

    Other phrases commonly used in Germany include: "Ein wackerer Bayer vertilgt ja bequem zwo Pfund Kalbshaxe" and, more recently, "Franz jagt im komplett verwahrlosten Taxi quer durch Bayern", but both lack umlauts and esszet. Previously, going for the shortest sentence that has all the umlauts and special characters, I had "Grüße aus Bärenhöfe (und Óechtringen)!" Acute accents are not used in native German words, so I was surprised to discover "Óechtringen" in the Deutsche Bundespost Postleitzahlenbuch:

        Click for full-size image (2.8MB)

    It's a small village in eastern Lower Saxony. The "oe" in this case turns out to be the Lower Saxon "lengthening e" (Dehnungs-e), which makes the previous vowel long (used in a number of Lower Saxon place names such as Soest and Itzehoe), not the "e" that indicates umlaut of the preceding vowel. Many thanks to the Óechtringen-Namenschreibungsuntersuchungskomitee (Alex Bochannek, Manfred Erren, Asmus Freytag, Christoph Päper, plus Werner Lemberg who serves as Óechtringen-Namenschreibungsuntersuchungskomiteerechtschreibungsprüfer) for their relentless pursuit of the facts in this case. Conclusion: the accent almost certainly does not belong on this (or any other native German) word, but neither can it be dismissed as dirt on the page. To add to the mystery, it has been reported that other copies of the same edition of the PLZB do not show the accent! UPDATE (March 2006): David Krings was intrigued enough by this report to contact the mayor of Ebstorf, of which Oechtringen is a borough, who responded:

        Sehr geehrter Mr. Krings,
        wenn Oechtringen irgendwo mit einem Akzent auf dem O geschrieben wurde, dann kann das nur ein Fehldruck sein. Die offizielle Schreibweise lautet jedenfalls „Oechtringen“.
        Mit freundlichen Grüssen
        Der Samtgemeindebürgermeister
        i.A. Lothar Jessel

    From Karl Pentzlin (Kochel am See, Bavaria, Germany): "This German phrase is suited for display by a Fraktur (broken letter) font. It contains: all common three-letter ligatures: ffi ffl fft and all two-letter ligatures required by the Duden for Fraktur typesetting: ch ck ff fi fl ft ll ſch ſi ſſ ſt tz (all in a manner such they are not part of a three-letter ligature), one example of f-l where German typesetting rules prohibit ligating (marked by a ZWNJ), and all German letters a...z, ä,ö,ü,ß, ſ [long s] (all in a manner such that they are not part of a two-letter Fraktur ligature)." Otto Stolz notes that "'Schloß' is now spelled 'Schloss', in contrast to 'größer' (example 4) which has kept its 'ß'. Fraktur has been banned from general use, in 1942, and long-s (ſ) has ceased to be used with Antiqua (Roman) even earlier (the latest Antiqua-ſ I have seen is from 1913, but then I am no expert, so there may well be a later instance." Later Otto confirms the latter theory, "Now I've run across a book “Deutsche Rechtschreibung” (edited by Lutz Mackensen) from 1954 (my reprint is from 1956) that has kept the Antiqua-ſ in its dictionary part (but neither in the preface nor in the appendix)."

    Diaeresis is not used in Iberian Portuguese.

    From Yurio Miyazawa: "This poetry contains all the sounds in the Japanese language and used to be the first thing for children to learn in their Japanese class. The Hiragana version is particularly neat because it covers every character in the phonetic Hiragana character set." Yurio also sent the Kanji version:

        色は匂へど 散りぬるを
        我が世誰ぞ 常ならむ
        有為の奥山 今日越えて
        浅き夢見じ 酔ひもせず

    Finnish pangrams from Mikko Ristilä.

Accented Cyrillic:

(This section contributed by Vladimir Marinov.)

In Bulgarian it is desirable, customary, or in some cases required to write accents over vowels. Unfortunately, no computer character sets contain the full repertoire of accented Cyrillic letters. With Unicode, however, it is possible to combine any Cyrillic letter with any combining accent. The appearance of the result depends on the font and the rendering engine. Here are two examples.

    Той видя бялата коса́ по главата и́ и ко́са на рамото и́, и ре́че да и́ рече́: "Пара́та по́ па́ри от па́рата, не ща пари́!", но си поми́сли: "Хей, помисли́ си! А́ и́ река, а́ е скочила в тази река, която щеше да тече́, а не те́че."

    По пъ́тя пъту́ват кю́рди и югославя́ни.

Meme

IGP alum Ethan Mollick ’97 created the “I Can Eat Glass” project during his time at Harvard. The project turned into one of the first famous Internet memes, and the original page was housed on the IGP website for several years before being taken down. Now, it is back where it belongs, and the current members of IGP have taken up the task of keeping the project going. Updates to come, but for now enjoy Ethan’s original work.

The Idea

The concept of the “I Can Eat Glass” Project is simple– to compile a list of ways to say the phrase “I can eat glass, it doesn’t hurt me” in various languages. Pretty easy, eh?

The Philosophy

This Project is, of course, completely trivial. Still, I feel a need to justify it, so pick your favorite reason, or give me your suggestions by email or comment form:

* The Project is based on the idea that people in a foreign country have an irresistable urge to try to say something in the indigenous tongue. In most cases, however, the best a person can do is “Where is the bathroom?” a phrase that marks them as a tourist. But, if one says “I can eat glass, it doesn’t hurt me,” you will be viewed as an insane native, and treated with dignity and respect.
* The Project is a challenge to the human spirit, in much the same way as the Apollo Program or the Panama Canal was, except that it involves much less digging and slightly less spaceflight.
* The Project is part of an attempt to procrastinate when I should be doing reading.
* The Project is a product of the social framework in which it was created, and thus by studying the Project, you are truly studying Western Civilization.
* The Project is the result of high technology in the hands of people who have no idea what to do with it.

The Project

The Project lists the language, the location in which it is spoken, how it would be written in the language (if the tongue uses the Roman alphabet), and a transliteration if available. Transliterations are in italics.

Main Entries

Afrikaans

Spoken in: South Africa, Namibia
In Afrikaans: “Ek kan glas eet, dit maak my nie seer nie.”
Alternately: “Ek kan glas eet, dit kan my nie seermaak nie.”
Pronounciation: The g’s are like the gutteral Dutch sound but “eet” is a long “ee”, not the “ay” of Dutch. “My” is “may”.
Note: This language is one of the most recent major languages, derived from Dutch in this century.

Arabic

Spoken in: North Africa and the Middle East
In Transliterated Algerian Arabic: Nakdar nakoul ezjaj ou ma youjaach.
In Egyptian Arabic: Ana momken aakol el-ezaz, we dah ma beyewgaaneash
Notes: Egyptian Arabic is the most popular Arabic dialect, this is due tothe huge backing of T.V. and radio all-over the Arab world. It is also spoken by 50 million people as a mother tongue which puts it on the top of the list of all arabic dialects. Unfortunately anything that has to be written will be translated to classical form first that’s why this and other Arabic dialects tend to be only spoken.

Aracnol

Spoken in: Online Portuguese community
In Aracnol: “poh sukumer vidro. nam-u mieh dzagradahvel.”
Pronounced: “paw soo koomair vee-drew. nown mee Eh dzu grudah vell.”
Note: Aracnol is an artificial language, developed when Portuguese-speakers were unable to use accents in email messages. It has since developed its own grammers and expressions. Compare with Portuguese below.

Aragones

Spoken in: Aragon (Spanish State, Europe)
In Aragones: Puedo (en) minchar (de) beire, no me’n fa mal
Pronounced: puedo (en) minCHar (de) beire, no men fa mal. (CH=English T)
Compare with Spanish below.

Armenian

Spoken in: Armenia, Lebanon, Iran, Turkey
In Armenian: Abagee grnam oodel yev eendzy tche venassér.

Note: The above is represented by bytes of eight bits each (how the string “I can eat glass, it doesn’t hurt me” would actually be stored in memory). Each byte is one character. Conveniently enough, bytes are organized into words of four bytes each. Curiously, the phrase is exactly nine words long in computer memory.

Translation: I can eat glass. Not sure if it will hurt me. If I can eat glass, it won’t hurt me.

C++

Spoken in: Computers
In C++:

#include

class me {
public:
/* bool eatGlass(void)

Returns true if the object has indeed started eating glass,
false otherwise */
bool eatGlass(void) {
return (eatingGlass = true);

if (I.eatGlass())
cout << "I can eat glass";

if (!I.isInjured())
cout << ", it does not hurt me." << endl;

return 0;
}

Cape Verdean Creole (crioulo or kriôlu)

Spoken in: Cape Verde, emigrants in Lisbon and Boston.
In Creole: “M’tá podê kumê vidru, ká stá máguame.”
Pronounciation: The first “m” means “I” and is just a sweet nasalation: you close your mouth and use your nose. It’s something like a small “mmmh”.
Note: This language is a mixture of Portugese and African languages from Senegal and Guinea-Bissau.

Catalan

Spoken in: Spanish Mediterranean coast, southern France, Balearic Islands and a city of Italy
In Catalan: “Puc menjar vidre que no em fa mal”

Note: the apostrophe represents a glotteral stop.

Chinese (Cantonese)

Spoken in: Hong Kong & Guangdong province, China
In Cantonese: Ngo Hor Yi Sak Bor Laai, Kui Sern Ng Do Ngo Gar

Chinese (Mandarin)

Spoken in: China
In Mandarin:
Transliteration (using the Pinyin system): “Wo ke yi chi bo li, wo bu huei sho shang”
Notes: There are different systems for converting Chinese (Mandarin, Cantonese, Haka, etc.) speech to roman text, one of them is Pinyin. As an example ‘I’ or ‘me’ in Mandarin is written ‘wo’ in pinyin. Every sound like ‘wo’ can be pronounced in 4 ‘tunes’, or changes in tone. In this case ‘wo’ is in the third tone. To pronounce it, first the pitch of your voice goes down a little, then rises. In pinyin this is pictured by placing a ‘v’ on top of the o (like ô but just the other way around). Unfortunately, this is currently not supported by HTML characters.

Czech

Spoken in: Czech Republic
In Czech: “Muzu jíst sklo; to mi neskodí.”
Pronounced: MOO-zhoo yeest skloh; toh mee NEH-shkoh-dee.
Alternately: “Muzu jíst sklo, to mi nic neudelá.”
Pronounced: MOO-zhoo yeest skloh, toh mee nyeets NEH-oo-dye-lah.
Notes: In “muzu,” there is a little circle over the u (like the å in Swedish or Norwegian). Also, there is an inverted circumflex over the z (an upside-down ^). There is an inverted circumflex over the s in “neskodí”m and in the alternate version, over the second e in “neudelá”. The first version is generally used to describe realistic action.

Danish

Spoken in: Denmark, Iceland, Greenland
In Danish:”Jeg kan spise glas, det gør ikke ondt på mig”.

Dan-Rur

Spoken in: The Oz books by L. Frank Baum and his successors. Spoken by fairies and humans in Burzee, the Nome Kingdom, and Antozia. From the language family Fairy, which is not descended from Nostratic.
In Dan-Rur: “Nel akkeai-ugoil ureil; ai moirshoai nel.”
Literally: “Person-of-low-station to eat-is-able-in-absolute-present glass; this hurts-in-fiction person-of-low-station.
Pronounciation: Highly variable according to location and species.

Dutch

Spoken in: The Netherlands, St. Maartan
In Dutch: “Ik kan glas eten. Het doet geen pijn.”
Pronounced: Ik kan khlas ayten. Hayt dot khayn pine.

Eskimo (Central Alaksan Yup’ik Eskimo)

Spoken in: Southwestern Alaska
In Eskimo: Cikunguaq nernarqaqa, akngirtanga.

Esperanto

Spoken in: Esperanto Clubs throughout the world
In Esperanto: Mi povas mangxi vitron, gxi min ne doloras.
Pronunciation: gx (g cirumflex) = dg as in ‘edge’.

Estonian

Spoken in: Estonia
In Estonian: Ma võin klaasi süüa, see ei tee mulle midagi
Pronounced: Mah vUH-in klAAH-see sYEWah, say eye TAY mOOlleh mEEtakee
Notes: Estonian, a close relative of Finnish, is spoken by the approximately one million native inhabitants of the small Baltic state of Estonia, which has a large Russian-speaking community (approx. 500,000) left over from the half century during which the country was colonized by the Soviet Union. Estonia’s independence was restored in 1991.

Fante

Spoken in: Southern Ghana
Trasnsliteration: Motum awe bodambo. Onye me hwee.
Pronunciation: similar to Twi, and o=long o.

Finnish

Spoken in: Finland
In Finnish: “Pystyn sy&oumlmään lasia. Se ei koske yhtään.”
Pronounced:PUstun SUomaan LAHseeah. Se ay CASS-keh UH-tahn
Literally: “I can eat glass, it does not hurt (me) at all.”
Alternately: “Pystyn sy&oumlmään lasia. Se ei koske minuun yhtään.”
Literally: “I can eat glass, it does not hurt me at all.”
Note: The implied “me” sounds more natural in Finnish.

French

Spoken in: France, Canada, various former colonies
In French: “Je peux manger du verre, cela ne me fait pas mal.”
However: French distinguishes between being able to physically and knowing how to. “Je sais” means “I can” in the second sense. Secondly, French distinguishes between the generic “le verre” (“glass” in general) and the particular “du verre” (“(some) glass”). ie if you know how to go about it properly, you can eat glass without it hurting (“Je sais… le verre”).
This may thus be more correct: “Je sais manger le verre; cela ne me fait pas mal.”
In modern colloquial French: “Ch’peux manger du verre, ca m’fait pas mal.”
In seventeenth-century French alexandrine verse (as spoken by Racine, Boileau, La Fontaine, and Molière): “Je puis manger du verre; cela ne me nuit point.”
Note: The previously displayed alexandrine has 13 syllables. Although Classical French tolerated13, 12 syllables was, and is now, the norm.
Thus: “Je mange le verre; cela ne me nuit point.”

Frisian

Spoken in: Province of Friesland, Netherlands
In Frisian: ik kin gl^es ite, it docht me net sear
Pronounced: ick kin gle-es ee-tuh, ut doxt mu net seer
Notes: x=ch in German or x in Russian, u and uh are pronounced like in circ_u_s and ^e sounds like “mess” but with two syllables.

German

Note: This is a more natural saying which translates as “I can eat glass; It doesn’t put me in or out”

Alternately: Watashiwa garasu o taberarete, watashi o kizutsukemasen.
Alternately: Watashiwa garasu o taberarete, kizutsukemasen.

Kelabit

Spoken in: Sarawak, Malaysia
In Kelabit: “Uih kereb kuman gelas, na’am inih belu’an na’an.”
Literally: “I can eat glass, not it hurt later.”
Notes: Kelabit is a language from the interior of Borneo. They had no word for glass before the British arrived during WWII. Go here for some more information. Given the nature of the subject matter (eating glass) the translator assumed that most native Kelabit speakers would say that it would make them “sick” (as opposed to hurt or injured) or rather “not make mesick” (na’am inih naru’ ma’it). The word glass in this context would probably be confused with a drinking glass. The only other word that they have for glass is the one meaning windowpane, which they have borrowed from Malaysian (Kelingai).

Transliterated: HIvje’ mep vISoplaH. mu’oy’moHbe’.

In Lojban: “mi ka’e citka loi blaci .i la’edi’u na xrani mi”
Pronounced: mee KAhey SHITkah loi BLAshi (pause) ee laheDIhoo na KHRAni mee.
Pronounciation: the apostrophe is an unvoiced stop, usually rendered much like the English “h”, the “x” is like German “ch”, and the “c” is like English “sh”. Vowels are like the European long vowels. The period represents a pause.

LPC

Spoken in: MUDs
In LPC: inherit OBJECT;

void create() {
set_id({“glass”, “broken glass”, “piece of glass”, “piece of broken glass”});

Transliteration: “ml foti yeh ba darega, ` ml ki nggweh”
Note: The contributer cannot vouch for the grammar of the first phrase – there’s an ambiguity in the tense. He has used “ba”, which is present continuous, but would need to check it with a native speaker.

Nederlands

Spoken in: the Netherlands, Flemish part of Belgium
In Nederlands: Ik kan glas eten, het doet geen pijn.

Neo-Melanesian

Spoken in: The Melanesian Pacific Isles
In Neo-Melanesian: “Mipela inap kaikai gilas na em i no inap killim mi liklik”
Literally: “I am enough to eat glass and it is not enough to hurt me a little bit”
Note: The degree of hurt expressed can be modified in this way:
Killim Liklik = Hurt a bit
Killim = Hurt
Killim Pinis (Kill ‘im finish) = Hurt a lot
Killim I dai = Kill him dead
Second Note: This is the ‘Pidgin’ languages of the Melanesian Pacific Isles. A mixture of German, English, Dutch and various indigenous languages hung on a melanesian grammar frame.

Norwegian

In Norwegian: “Jeg kan spise glas. Det gjør meg ikke vondt.”

Old Ozzish

Alternately: Moge jesc szklo, mnie to nie boli.
Pronounced: MO-ga yeshtch shkwo, mnia to nia BO-lee.
Notes: In the 1st sentence, you can omit “Ja”, which means “I”, but is understood anyway from the form of the verb “moge”=”I can.” Another thing: “boli” means “hurts” in the physical sense of pain, while “szkodzi” means “harm” or “injure” or “bother” in a general sense.

Portuguese

Spoken in: Portugal, Brazil, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique and São Tomé and Príncipe, as well as the controversal regions of East Timor and Macau

Literally: I can eat glass, it doesn’t hurt me.
Alternately [and most correct]:”Posso comer vidro, não me faz mal.”
Literally: I can eat glass, it does me no wrong.
In Brazilian coloquial Portuguese: “Consigo comer vidro. Não me machuca.”
Pronunciation: ay-oo kon-SEE-goo koo-MAYR VEE-droo. nown mee mah-SHOO-kah.
Note: In all of these, the “I” is implicit, to make it explicit, add “Eu” to the begining of the sentence.
In Galizan Portuguese, spoken in Galiza, Spain: “Eu sou capaz de comer vidro: não me lastima.”
Pronounced: ‘Ew ‘sow ka’pas de ko’mer ‘bidro — ‘nõN me las’tima
Alternately: “Podo comer cristal, non me fai mal”

Notes: Galizan Portuguese (or Galizan, or “Galician”) is a variety of Portuguese spoken in Galiza (northwest of Spain) by more than 2 milion people. Even though its spoken varieties have been strongly Castilianized through the centuries, structurally Galizan is basically Portuguese. Still, a strong case can be made that it is an independent language.

Saint Lucian Patwa or Kweyol

Spoken in: St. Lucia
In Patwa: “Mwen sa manjé glas, i pa ka fé mwen mal.”
Note from Paul Garrett, anthropologist: St. Lucia is an island of 238 sqaure miles, a neighbor of Martinique (to the north), St. Vincent and the Grenadines (to the south), and Barbados (to the east). English is the official language now, but St. Lucia was colonized by the French from the late seventeenth century until the English won it away from the French in 1814–and even after that, the French colonial influence remained stronger than the English for several decades. (It’s now, as of 1979, an independent state within the Commonwealth.) A French-lexicon creole is still widely spoken–some old rural people are still monolingual in the language. It’s generally referred to as “Patwa” by its speakers, and that’s what I generally call it too. But there’s a movement afoot to get people to start calling it “Kweyol” (acute accent on the E, grave accent on the O) as a matter of national pride, since some think that “Patwa” is derogatory, a relic of the colonial past. You can call it by either/both of those labels, or you can call it “St. Lucian French-lexified creole”, which is more technical but more descriptive.

Scottish Gaelic

Spoken in: Scotland, by about 80,000 speakers
In Scottish Gaelic: ‘S urrainn dhomh gloinne ithe; cha ghoirtich i mi.
Pronounced: SOO-reen gaw gloyn-yuh ich-uh; cha gorshtich ee mee.

Sindarin (Elvish)

Spoken in: the works of J.R.R. Tolkien
In Sindarin: “Bathathon heled, im ú-cirath.”
Pronounced: BA-tha-thon HEH-led, eem oo-KEER-ath
Literally: “I will consume glass, it will not hurt me.”
Note: The Languages of Tolkien’s Middle-Earth by Ruth S. Noel suggests that the future tense can be used to imply ability. “Bath-” is a back-formed verb stem meaning “to consume,” derived from Quenya (a related Elvish language) vasa according to patterns established by other words.

Singlish (Corrrupted Singaporean English)

Spoken in: Singapore
In Singlish: “Can eat glass, lah, never hurt me, hoh!”
Pronounced: /ken EE’ gras lah, NEH-ver hu’ me, HOH/
Pronounciation note: Vowels clipped and nasalised. The /’/ represents a glottal stop. The “hoh” is pronounced entirely through the nose.
Alternatively: “Eat glass also can! I never kanah, wan!”
Pronounced: /Ea’ glas aw-so can! I NEH-vuh’ ka-NA, WAAHN!/
Pronounciation note: Same as before. “Kanah” is a word of dubious spelling, origin and meaning, generally implying punishment, pain, and other such unpleasantness, and enjoys widespread use in army barracks.
Malay-based alternative: “Makan glass, BOLEH! I don’t sakit, lor!”
Pronounced: /ma-kan glas BOH-lay! I don’ sah-ki’, laaw/
Literally: “Eat glass can! I don’t hurt”
Note: The words “lor”, “lah”, “wan” etc. are universal interjections and are usually interchangeable. Mix and match the versions at will!
Note on Singlish: Not quite a dialect; it is a controversial symptom of the infiltration of Malay, Tamil and various Chinese dialects into the old colonial language, English. The grammar of this alleged “language” is highly malleable (and has been condemned by the Authorities).

Notes: Pom is the first person singular pronoun which would be most appropriate for male foreigners to use, chan is for females.

Turkish

Spoken in: Turkey

Note: To look at a playful version of Turkish, see “Turkish Bird Language.”

In Lunfardo: Yo puedo manyar driovi, no me hace un carajo, no me hace.
Notes: Yo puedo=”I can”; manyar=”eat” (slang), driovi is from “vidrio” which means glass, so driovi is like saying “ssgla”; no me hace=”it doesn’t”; un carajo=a rude word for nothing… also an insult (not THAT rude); no me hace=people use to repeat some part of the paragraph.

Thus, to pacify Our Neighbors To The North, I am including one version of Newfie. One question– who do people from Newfoundland make fun of? This question has now been answered Newfies apparently make fun of people from Toronto and tell bad lightbulb jokes about them.

Newspeak

Spoken in: Oceania (from George Orwell’s _1984_)
In Newspeak: I can eat glass. It does not hurt me.
Pronounced: Like “I can eat glass. It does not hurt me.”
Notes: Newspeak was constructed to restrict thought to _goodthink_ (thought in line with the interests of the state) and to allow for easy expression of _goodthinkful_ ideas. The phrase comes through largely unscathed because it expresses a simple mechanical relationship, the only real change being in the punctuation. However, if made as an actual statement in real life, this would probably be tied in with the philosophical viewpoint of the speaker, hence something such as “_Glass does not hurt goodthinkful eaters_” or “_Unownlifers eat glass unhurtfully_,” which would require some _doublethink_ to rationalize. Some might even say “I am a doubleplusgood unhurtful eater of glass.”

Wunne Pekke

Spoken: dal.net #watertower channel, alt.tv.animaniacs
In Wunne Pekke: Hiyye canne hette lasse, hitte duzze notte hurre miyye.
Pronounced: Hi can het lass, hit duz not hurr me.
Note: Wunne Pekke is language invented by a member of alt.tv.animaniacs, and is written and spoken in that newsgroup and on the dal.net channel #watertower. It consists of spelling all words consonant-vowel- consonant-consonant-vowel, like the names of Yakko and Wakko Warner from the cartoon show Animaniacs. All words are translated into that letter pattern, with silent letters added and two-letter sounds turned into one letter.

Awards

The ICEGP has received some…. well, honors is not the right word, perhaps recognition:

* It was featured among the Useless Pages on the World Wide Web
* It has been listed as providing “great armchair Whorfian speculation material” by the Humanist Discussion Group, which I think is a good thing.
* There was a short, on-line article on the Project in “Fresh Stuff,” a neat e-zine.
* It has also been reviewed by the Learning Lab section of the June issue of Netguide magazine which gave it a coveted single star, which apparently means that it preferable to shoot oneself instead of seeing this page. Obviously, Netguide is a magazine of little class and should be avoided.
* It is a teaching tool at the University of Texas-Austin!
* Thanks for making this the #9 site on the Harvard Web. ICEGP accounts for almost half a percent of all traffic on the www.fas.harvard.edu site. (Note: this is probably no longer true, but we aim to change that!)
* The project has also been featured in “Yahoo” magazine! Cool, no?

#############################
# edX Introduction to Linux #
#############################

Chapter 1 - The Linux Foundation Summary  


* The Linux Foundation is a nonprofit consortium dedicated to fostering the growth of Linux.
* The Linux Foundation training is for the community and by the community. Linux training is distribution-flexible, technically advanced, and created with the leaders of the Linux development community.
* There are three major distribution families within Linux: Fedora, SUSE and Debian. In this course we will work with representative members of all of these families throughout.


Chapter 2 - Linux Philosophy and Concepts Summary


* Linux borrows heavily from the UNIX operating system, with which its creators were well versed. 
* Linux accesses many features and services through files and file-like objects.
* Linux is a fully multitasking, multiuser operating system, with built-in networking and service processes known as daemons.
* Linux is developed by a loose confederation of developers from all over the world, collaborating over the Internet, with Linus Torvalds at the head. Technical skill and a desire to contribute are the only qualifications for participating.
* The Linux community is a far reaching ecosystem of developers, vendors, and users that supports and advances the Linux operating system.
* Some of the common terms used in Linux are: Kernel, Distribution, Boot loader, Service, Filesystem, X Window system, desktop environment, and command line.
* A full Linux distribution consists of the kernel plus a number of other software tools for file-related operations, user management, and software package management.


Chapter 3 - Linux Structure and Installation Summary


* A partition is a logical part of the disk.
* A filesystem is a method of storing/finding files on a hard disk.
* By dividing the hard disk into partitions, data can be grouped and separated as needed. When a failure or mistake occurs, only the data in the affected partition will be damaged, while the data on the other partitions will likely survive.
* The boot process has multiple steps, starting with BIOS, which triggers the boot loader to start up the Linux kernel. From there the initramfs filesystem is invoked, which triggers the init program to complete the startup process.
* Determining the appropriate distribution to deploy requires that you match your specific system needs to the capabilities of the different distributions


Chapter 4 - Graphical Interface Summary


* GNOME is a popular desktop environment and graphical user interface that runs on top of the Linux operating system.
* The default display manager for GNOME is called gdm.
* The gdm display manager presents the user with the login screen which prompts for the login username and password.
* Logging out through the desktop environment kills all processes in your current X session and returns to the display manager login screen.
* Linux enables users to switch between logged in sessions.
* Suspending puts the computer into sleep mode.
* For each key task, there is generally a default application installed.
* Every user created in the system will have a home directory.
* The Places menu contains entries that allow you to access different parts of the computer and the network.
* Nautilus gives three formats to view files.
* Most text editors are located in the Accessories submenu.
* Each Linux distribution comes with its own set of desktop backgrounds.
* GNOME comes with a set of different themes which can change the way your applications look.


Chapter 5 - System Configuration from the Graphical Interface


* You can control basic configuration options and desktop settings through the System Settings panel
* Linux always uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for its own internal time-keeping . You can set Date and Time Settings from the System Settings window.
* The Network Time Protocol is the most popular and reliable protocol for setting the local time via Internet servers.
* The Displays panel allows you to change the resolution of your display and configure multiple screens.
* Network Manager can present available wireless networks, allow the choice of a wireless or mobile broadband network, handle passwords, and set up VPNs.  dpkg and RPM are the most popular package management systems used on Linux distributions.
* Debian distributions use dpkg and apt-based utilities for package management.
* RPM was developed by Red Hat, and adopted by a number of other
distributions, including the openSUSE, Mandriva, CentOS, Oracle Linux, and others.


Chapter 6 - Finding Linux Documentation


* The main sources of Linux documentation are the man pages, GNU Info, the help options and command, and a rich variety of online documentation sources.  
* The man utility searches, formats, and displays man pages.
* The man pages provide in-depth documentation about programs and other topics about the system including configuration files, system calls, library routines, and the kernel.
* The GNU Info System was created by the GNU project as its standard documentation. It is robust and is accessible via command line, web, and graphical tools using info.
* Short descriptions for commands are usually displayed with the -h or --help argument.
* You can type help at the command line to display a synopsis of built-in commands.
* There are many other help resources both on your system and on the Internet.


Chapter 7 - Command Line Operations


* Virtual terminals (VT) in Linux are consoles, or command line terminals that use the connected monitor and keyboard.
* Different Linux distributions start and stop the graphical desktop in different ways.
* A terminal emulator program on the graphical desktop works by emulating a terminal within a window on the desktop.
* The Linux system allows you to either log in via text terminal or remotely via the console.
* When typing your password, nothing is printed to the terminal, not even a generic symbol to indicate that you typed.
* The preferred method to shut down or reboot the system is to use the shutdown command.
* There are two types of pathnames: absolute and relative.
* An absolute pathname begins with the root directory and follows the tree, branch by branch, until it reaches the desired directory or file.
* A relative pathname starts from the present working directory.
* Using hard and soft (symbolic) links is extremely useful in Linux.
* cd remembers where you were last, and lets you get back there with cd ..
* locate performs a database search to find all file names that match a given pattern.
* find locates files recursively from a given directory or set of directories.
* find is able to run commands on the files that it lists, when used with the -exec option.
* touch is used to set the access, change, and edit times of files as well as to create empty files.
* The Advanced Packaging Tool (apt) package management system is used to manage installed software on Debian-based systems.
* You can use the Yellowdog Updater Modified (yum) open-source command-line package-management utility for RPM-compatible Linux operating systems.
* The zypper package management system is based on RPM and used for openSUSE.


Chapter 8 - File Operations 


* The filesystem tree starts at what is often called the root directory (or trunk, or /).
* The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) provides Linux developers and system administrators a standard directory structure for the filesystem.
* Partitions help to segregate files according to usage, ownership and type.
* Filesystems can be mounted anywhere on the main filesystem tree at a mount point. Automatic filesystem mounting can be set up by editing /etc/fstab.
* NFS (The Network Filesystem) is a useful method for sharing files and data through the network systems.
* Filesystems like /proc are called pseudo filesystems because they exist only in memory.
* /root (slash-root) is the home directory for the root user.
* /var may be put in its own filesystem so that growth can be contained and not fatally affect the system.
* /boot contains the basic files needed to boot the system
* patch is a very useful tool in Linux. Many modifications to source code and configuration files are distributed with patch files as they contain the deltas or changes to go from an old version of a file to the new version of a file.
* File extensions in Linux do not necessarily mean that a file is of a certain type.
* cp is used to copy files on the local machine while rsync can also be used to copy files from one machine to another as well as synchronize contents.
* gzip, bzip2, xz and zip are used to compress files.
* tar allows you to create or extract files from an archive file, often called a tarball. You can optionally compress while creating the archive, and decompress while extracting its contents
* dd  can be used to make large exact copies even of entire disk partitions efficiently.


Chapter 9 - User Environment


* Linux is a multiuser system.
* To find the currently logged on users, you can use the who command.
* To find the current user ID, you can use the whoami command.
* The root account has full access to the system. It is never sensible to grant full root access to a user.
* You can assign root privileges to regular user accounts on a temporary basis using the sudo command.
* The shell program (bash) uses multiple startup files to create the user environment. Each file affects the interactive environment in a different way. /etc/profile provides the global settings.
* Advantages of startup files include that they customize the user's prompt, set the user's terminal type, set the command-line shortcuts and aliases, and set the default text editor, etc.
* An environment variable is a character string that contains data used by one or more applications. The built-in shell variables can be customized to suit your requirements.
* The history command recalls a list of previous commands which can be edited and recycled.
* In Linux, various keyboard shortcuts can be used at the command prompt instead of long actual commands.
* You can customize commands by creating aliases. Adding an alias to ˜/.bashrc will make it available for other shells.
* File permissions can be changed by typing chmod permissions filename.
- 4 if read (r) permission is desired.
- 2 if write (w) permission is desired.
- 1 if execute (x) permission is desired.
* File ownership is changed by typing chown owner filename.
* File group ownership is changed by typing chgrp group filename.


Chapter 10 - Text Editors


* Text editors (rather than word processing programs) are used quite often in Linux, for tasks such as for creating or modifying system configuration files, writing scripts, developing source code, etc.
* nano is an easy-to-use text-based editor that utilizes on-screen prompts.
* gedit is a graphical editor very similar to Notepad in Windows.
* The vi editor is available on all Linux systems and is very widely used. Graphical extension versions of vi are widely available as well.
* emacs is available on all Linux systems as a popular alternative to vi. emacs can support both a graphical user interface and a text mode interface.
* To access the vi tutorial, type vimtutor at a command line window.
* To access the emacs tutorial type Ctl-h and then t from within emacs.
* vi has three modes: Command, Insert, and Line; emacs has only one but requires use of special keys such as Control and Escape.
* Both editors use various combinations of keystrokes to accomplish tasks; the learning curve to master these can be long but once mastered using either editor is extremely efficient.


Chapter 11 - Local Security Principles


* The root account has authority over the entire system.
* root privileges may be required for tasks, such as restarting services, manually installing packages and managing parts of the filesystem that are outside your home directory.
* In order to perform any privileged operations such as system-wide changes, you need to use either su or sudo.
* Calls to sudo trigger a lookup in the /etc/sudoers file, or in the /etc/sudoers.d directory which first validates that the calling user is allowed to use sudo and that it is being used within permitted scope
* One of the most powerful features of sudo is its ability to log unsuccessful attempts at gaining root access.  By default sudo commands and failures are logged in /var/log/auth.log under the Debian family and /var/log/messages in other distribution families.
* One process cannot access another process’ resources, even when that process is running with the same user privileges.
* Using the user credentials, the system verifies the authenticity and identity.
* The SHA-512 algorithm is typically used to encode passwords. They can be encrypted but not decrypted.
* Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) can be configured to automatically verify that passwords created or modified using the passwd utility are strong enough (what is considered strong enough can also be configured).
* Your IT security policy should start with requirements on how to properly secure physical access to servers and workstations.
* Keeping your systems updated is an important step in avoiding security attacks.


Chapter 12 - Network Operations


* The IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique logical network address that is assigned to a device on a network.
* IPv4 uses 32-bits for addresses and IPv6 uses 128-bits for addresses.
* Every IP address contains both a network and a host address field.
* There are five classes of network addresses available: A, B, C, D & E.
* DNS (Domain Name System) is used for converting Internet domain and host names to IP addresses.
* The ifconfig program is used to display current active network interfaces.
* The commands ip addr show and ip route show can be used to view IP address and routing information.
* You can use ping to check if the remote host is alive and responding.
* You can use the route utility program to manage IP routing.
* You can monitor and debug network problems using networking tools.
* Firefox, Google Chrome, Chromium, and Epiphany are the main graphical browsers used in Linux.
* Non-graphical or text browsers used in Linux are Lynx, Links, and w3m.
* You can use wget to download webpages.
* You can use curl to obtain information about URL's.
* FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used to transfer files over a network.
* ftp, sftp, ncftp, and yafc are command line FTP clients used in Linux.
* You can use ssh to run commands on remote systems.


Chapter 13 - Manipulating Text


* The command line often allows the users to perform tasks more efficiently than the GUI.
* cat, short for concatenate, is used to read, print and combine files.
* echo displays a line of text either on standard output or to place in a file.
* sed is a popular stream editor often used to filter and perform substitutions on files and text data streams.
* awk is a interpreted programming language typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool.
* sort is used to sort text files and output streams in either ascending or descending order.
* uniq eliminates duplicate entries in a text file.
* paste combines fields from different files and can also extract and combine lines from multiple sources.
* join combines lines from two files based on a common field. It works only if files share a common field.
* split breaks up a large file into equal-sized segments.
* Regular expressions are text strings used for pattern matching. The pattern can be used to search for a specific location, such as the start or end of a line or a word.
* grep searches text files and data streams for patterns and can be used with regular expressions.
* tr translates characters, copies standard input to standard output, and handles special characters.
* tee accepts saves a copy of standard output to a file while still displaying at the terminal.
* wc (word count) displays the number of lines, words and characters in a file or group of files.
* cut extracts columns from a file.
* less views files a page at a time and allows scrolling in both directions.
* head displays the first few lines of a file or data stream on standard output. By default it displays 10 lines.
* tail displays the last few lines of a file or data stream on standard output. By default it displays 10 lines.
* strings extracts printable character strings from binary files.
* The z command family is used to read and work with compressed files.


Chapter 14 - Printing


* CUPS provides two command-line interfaces: the System V and BSD interfaces.
* The CUPS interface is available at http://localhost:631
* lp and lpr  are used to submit a document to CUPS directly from the command line.
* lpoptions can be used to set printer options and defaults.
* PostScript effectively manages scaling of fonts and vector graphics to provide quality prints.
* enscript is used to convert a text file to PostScript and other formats.
* Portable Document Format (PDF) is the standard format used to exchange documents while ensuring a certain level of consistency in the way the documents are viewed.
* pdftk joins and splits PDFs; pulls single pages from a file; encrypts and decrypts PDF files; adds, updates, and exports a PDF’s metadata; exports bookmarks to a text file; adds or removes attachments to a PDF; fixes a damaged PDF; and fills out PDF forms.
* pdfinfo can extract information about PDF documents.
* flpsed can add data to a PostScript document.
* pdfmod is a simple application with a graphical interface that you can use to modify PDF documents.


Chapter 15 - Bash Shell Scripting


* Scripts are a sequence of statements and commands stored in a file that can be executed by a shell. The most commonly used shell in Linux is bash.
* Command substitution allows you to substitute the result of a command as a portion of another command.
* Functions or routines are a group of commands that are used for execution.
* Environmental variables are quantities either pre-assigned by the shell or defined and modified by the user.
* To make environment variables visible to child processes, they need to be exported.
* Scripts can behave differently based on the parameters (values) passed to them.
* The process of writing the output to a file is called output redirection.
* The process of reading input from a file is called input redirection.
* The if statement is used to select an action based on a condition.
* Arithmetic expressions consist of numbers and arithmetic operators, such as +, -, and *.


Chapter 16 - Advanced Bash Scripting


* You can manipulate strings to perform actions such as comparison, sorting, and finding length.
* You can use Boolean expressions when working with multiple data types including strings or numbers as well as files.
* The output of a Boolean expression is either true or false.
* Operators used in Boolean expressions include the && (AND), ||(OR), and ! (NOT) operators.
* We looked at the advantages of using case statement in scenarios where the value of a variable can lead to different execution paths.
* Script debugging methods help troubleshoot and resolve errors.
* The standard and error outputs from a script or shell commands can easily be redirected into the same file or separate files to aid in debugging and saving results
* Linux allows you to create temporary files and directories, which store data for a short duration, both saving space and increasing security.
* Linux provides several different ways of generating random numbers, which are widely used.


Chapter 17 - 


* Processes are used to perform various tasks on the system.
* Processes can be single-threaded or multi-threaded.
* Processes can be of different types such as interactive and non-interactive.
* Every process has a unique identifier (PID) to enable the operating system to keep track of it.
* The nice value, or niceness, can be used to set priority.
- lower the nice value, the higher its priority (i.e. will not yield to others)
- higher the nice value, the lower its prioity (i.e. will yield to others)
* ps provides information about the currently running processes.
* You can use top to get constant real-time updates about overall system performance as well as information about the processes running on the system.
-htop is a variation of this command
* Load average indicates the amount of utilization the system is under at particular times.
- divide the output number by the number of cores your CPU has (e.g. quad core then divide by 4)
* Linux supports background and foreground processing for a job.
-create a job by appending a command with the &
-bg %job_number
-fg %job_number
* at executes any non-interactive command at a specified time.
* cron is used to schedule tasks that need to be performed at regular intervals.
- ls /etc/cron.* (e.g. shows /etc/cron.daily and the other interval directories)


Chapter 18 - Common Applications


* Linux offers a wide variety of Internet applications such as web browsers, email clients, online media applications, and others.
* Web browsers supported by Linux can be either graphical or text-based such as Firefox, Google Chrome, Epiphany, w3m, lynx and others.
* Linux supports graphical email clients, such as Thunderbird, Evolution, and Claws Mail, and text mode email clients, such as mutt and mail.
* Linux systems provide many other applications for performing Internet-related tasks, such as Filezilla, XChat, Pidgin, and others.
* Most Linux distributions offer LibreOffice to create and edit different kinds of documents.
* Linux systems offer entire suites of development applications and tools, including compilers and debuggers.
* Linux systems offer a number of sound players including Amarok, Audacity, and Rhythmbox.
* Linux systems offer a number of movie players including VLC, MPlayer, Xine, and Totem.
* Linux systems offer a number of movie editors including Kino, Cinepaint, Blender among others.
* The GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) utility is a feature-rich image retouching and editing tool available on all Linux distributions.
* Other graphics utilities that help perform various image-related tasks are eog, Inkscape, convert, and Scribus.
