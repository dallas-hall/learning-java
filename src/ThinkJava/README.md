# ThinkJavaCode
Supporting code for *Think Java* by Allen Downey and Chris Mayfield.

This is a Git repository that contains the code examples from the book and starter code for some exercises.

Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of the files that make up a project.
A collection of files under Git's control is called a repository.

There are several ways you can work with the code:
*   You can edit and run the code on [Codiva online java IDE](https://www.codiva.io/tutorials/thinkjavacode).

*   You can create a copy of this repository on GitHub by pressing the "Fork" button in the upper right.
If you don't already have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one.
After forking, you'll have your own repository on GitHub that you can use to keep track of code you write.
Then you can ``clone'' the repository, which downloads a copy of the files to your computer.

*   Alternatively, you could clone the repository without forking.
If you choose this option, you don't need a GitHub account, but you won't be able to save your changes back in GitHub.

*   If you don't want to use Git at all, you can download the code in a zip archive using the "Download ZIP" button on this page, or [this link](http://tinyurl.com/ThinkJavaCodeZip).

To clone a repository, you need a Git client installed on your computer.
The URL of this repository is `https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkJavaCode.git`.
If you use Git from the command line, you can clone it like this:

    git clone https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkJavaCode.git

After you clone the repository or unzip the zip file, you should have a directory called `ThinkJavaCode` with a subdirectory for each chapter in the book.

All examples in this book were developed and tested using Java SE Development Kit 8.
If you are using a more recent version, the examples in this book should still work.
If you are using an older version, some of them may not.
