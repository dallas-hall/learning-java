     * A Prime Number can be divided evenly only by 1 or itself (it has 2 factors only, 1 and itself).
     * Any whole number greater than 1 is either Prime or Composite, 
     * 1 is not Prime and also not Composite, it is a neutral number.
     * 
     *  n % 1 == 0 is true for ALL integers
     *  n % n (n being same number both times but != 0) always == 0
     * 
     *  prime numbers only have 2 divisors (factors) - 1 and itself
     *  composite numbers have at least 3 divisors (factors), they can have more depending on the number.
     *  
     *  example: 12 is composite, its factors are 1,12, 3,4, 6,2
     *  because: 1x12=12, 3x4=12 and 6x2=12
     * 
     *  This is why (n % i == 0) is not prime - 12 % 2 ==
     * 
     * 20:39 - CUdyin: how many whole divisors does a prime have?
     * 20:39 - blindcan't.: only 2 factors, 1 and itself
     * 20:39 - CUdyin: yep, how many divisors does any integer that is _not_ a prime have _at least_?
     * 20:40 - blindcan't.: well that depends what the number is, so at least 3?
     * 20:40 - CUdyin: precisely, any integer that isn't prime (and >1 ;) is the product of at least 2 primes
     * 20:40 - CUdyin: so at least 2 prime factors and 1 are its divisors
     * 20:41 - CUdyin: so let's assume that a given number n is prime
     * 20:41 - CUdyin: what happens if we find another divisor for n that isn't one of 1 or n itself?
     * 20:42 - blindcan't.: ah, its now a composite number and thus not prime
     * 20:42 - CUdyin: precisely, and that's what the loop is doing
     * 20:43 - CUdyin: it tries to find another divisor
     * 20:43 - CUdyin: and if that thing divides the 'prime', then n%x == 0 :P
     * 20:44 - CUdyin: so n wasn't a prime to start with
